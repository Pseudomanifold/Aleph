title: Building Aleph

# Building Aleph

Aleph uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system. In the best
case, all dependencies will automatically be identified. Please use
your package manager to install the following dependencies:

* A recent C++ compiler with support for C++11 and, preferably, C++14.
  Aleph is being continuously built by `g++`, the C++ compiler of the
  GNU project, and `clang++`, the C++ compiler of the LLVM project.
  Other compiler may or may not work. Please open an
  [issue](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/Aleph/issues) if you require
  another compiler.
* `CMake`, preferably a recent version >= 3.2
* Several `Boost` dependencies for some of the data structures:
  * `Boost.Functional`
  * `Boost.Iterator`
  * `Boost.MultiIndex`

Aleph is meant to be used as a header-only library on top of which you
can develop your own projects based on persistent homology. However,
Aleph ships with numerous unit tests, some example programs, and tools
required for my current research. For building them, please clone the
repository to some local directory on your computer. Running the
following commands within this directory should be sufficient in most
cases:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

It is advisable to test that Aleph works correctly on your system, so
you can run the unit tests with:

    $ make test

A typical output of this command should look like this:

    Running tests...

Please submit any issues you may encounter. If you want to help, please

## Binding to Python

If you want to install Aleph and bind it to its python function, do make sure you have `PYBIND11` installed. If you don't, you might get something like the following output when trying to use it:

```
$ python3
>>> import aleph
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/.../python3.x/site-packages/aleph/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    from .aleph import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aleph.aleph'
```

Furthermore, you might get something like the following as part of the output when you run `ccmake .` inside the `build/` directory.

```
PYBIND11_DIR                                                                                                  
PYBIND11_INCLUDE_DIR             PYBIND11_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND  
```

In this case, install `PYBIND11` both for python3 and for c/c++. For this, do:

```sh
pip3 install pybind11
```

and

```sh
# Clone, build and install
git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git
cd pybind11
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

# Additional options

Some of the components of Aleph may be disabled if you want to increase
performance of the build. Currently, these components include the
examples and the tools. Use `ccmake .` in the build directory to get an
overview of the available options. A typical output of this command
would be:

    BUILD_EXAMPLES        ON
    BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS ON
    BUILD_TOOLS           ON

Toggle the required options and re-configure the project in order to
change what is built.

# Installing Aleph

Having built Aleph, you can install the library as follows:

    $ make install

It is possible to change the installation prefix of Aleph using either
`cmake` or `ccmake`, the console front-end. To set another prefix upon
building Aleph, you may use the following command:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation/directory ../
    $ make install

Package files (for certain Linux distributions) are forthcoming. Please
refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/Aleph/issues/27)
for more details.
